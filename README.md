# Disk-Scheduler
### **Disk Scheduling Simulator**    This Python-based tool simulates **FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, and C-SCAN** disk scheduling algorithms. It calculates **seek time, average seek time, and system throughput**, then visualizes disk head movement using Matplotlib. Users input disk requests, head position, and select an algorithm to analyze performance.
